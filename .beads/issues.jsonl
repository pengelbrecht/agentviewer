{"id":"agentviewer-7xl","title":"Git-Based Diff Display","description":"Enable agentviewer to compute and display diffs directly from git, rather than requiring the caller to compute and pass diff content.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently, agents must compute diffs externally and pass the full diff content. With git-based diffs:\n- Simpler API for agents - just pass a file path\n- Agentviewer handles git diff computation internally\n- Support for different diff modes (unstaged, staged, commits, branches)\n- Less data to transfer (path vs full diff content)\n\n## API Design\nNew parameters for diff tabs:\n- `path`: File path to diff (required for git-based diffs)\n- `diffMode`: How to compute the diff:\n  - `\"unstaged\"` - Working directory vs index (default)\n  - `\"staged\"` - Index vs HEAD\n  - `\"head\"` - Working directory vs HEAD\n  - `\"commit:\u003csha\u003e\"` - Changes introduced by a specific commit\n  - `\"range:\u003cfrom\u003e..\u003cto\u003e\"` - Diff between two refs\n\n## Example Usage\n```bash\n# Show unstaged changes\ncurl -X POST /api/tabs -d '{\n  \"type\": \"diff\",\n  \"path\": \"/path/to/file.go\",\n  \"diffMode\": \"unstaged\"\n}'\n\n# Show staged changes\ncurl -X POST /api/tabs -d '{\n  \"type\": \"diff\", \n  \"path\": \"/path/to/file.py\",\n  \"diffMode\": \"staged\"\n}'\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] API accepts path + diffMode for diff tabs\n- [ ] Runs git diff internally and displays result\n- [ ] Proper error handling for non-git repos and invalid paths\n- [ ] Works with existing diff rendering (diff2html)\n- [ ] CLI help updated with git diff examples","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-07T21:03:36.226131+01:00","created_by":"peterengelbrecht","updated_at":"2026-01-07T21:03:36.226131+01:00"}
